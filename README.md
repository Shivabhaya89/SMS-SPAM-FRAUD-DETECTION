# SMS-SPAM-FRAUD-DETECTION

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a spam SMS fraud detection system. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. Spam SMS messages are a common nuisance and can sometimes be used for fraudulent activities, hence it's important to have a reliable system to filter them out.
